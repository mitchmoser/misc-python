# Misc Python
This is a collection of scripts I've worked on that aren't stand-alone projects but I feel are interesting enough to share.

Script | Function | Primary Libraries
-----: | :------- | :----------------
`clock.py` | Generates a GUI window that displays time and updates every second | tkinter
`duckduckgo.py` | Returns the titles and links to the first page results of a DuckDuckGo search | mechanicalsoup
`feelingLucky.py` | Returns the url for the Feeling Lucky link of a Google Search | mechanicalsoup
`zen.py` | Prints the Zen of Python centered to the terminal | this, codecs, shutil
